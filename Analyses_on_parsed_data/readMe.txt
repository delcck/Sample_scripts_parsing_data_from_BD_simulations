This respiratory contains a set of Matlab scripts that analyze biophysic-related properties of the system that we performed BD simulations on.
These scripts are built with the assumption that BD data are already parsed using scripts at: "Sample_scripts_parsing_data_from_BD_simulations
/".

As these scripts are used for an on-going project, they will bear updates in the future, and likely with better arrangement of codes
Lastly, based on the similarity between Matlab and numpy, these scripts can be readily rewritten into python scripts.
